# moodle-block_forum_report

* The basics of this report have been merged into the Forum Summary Report in Moodle. However, we have added new columns and improved the content since that time.

## 1. Install

1) Get the code using git by running the following command in the top level folder of your Moodle install:

`git clone git://github.com/nakaharatt/moodle-block_forum_report.git blocks/forum_report`

2) Login to Moodle as the admin user and click on Notifications in the Site Administration panel.
