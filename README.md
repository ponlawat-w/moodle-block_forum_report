# moodle-block_forum_report

* The basics of this report have been merged into the Forum Summary Report in Moodle. However, we have added new columns and improved the content since that time.
* This report shows the following information across all forums (or selected forums) in a course:
* --> User info
* --> Number of posts
* --> Number of replies
* --> Number of views
* --> Number of active days posting in the specified date range
* --> Number of active days viewing in the specified date range
* --> Number of multimedia items (images, videos, etc) added to posts
* --> Date of first post
* --> Date of last post
